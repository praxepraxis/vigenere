# This algorithm consists of a 'main' script, vinegerex.m, and operates onto
# four functions, namely vcipher, encrypt, vdecipher, and decrypt to produce a
# ciphertext enciphered via the use of Vigenere's algorithm (Vinegere cipher).
# It prompts the user for a plaintext and a key, and proceeds to map plaintext's
# and key's literals to the numeral space (i.e. to equivalences 1 to 26).
# Functions vcipher and encrypt operate bivariatly on plaintext and key to yield
# the ciphertext. The program then displays encoding into ciphertext of said
# plaintext, as a function of the key. To prove its reconstruction, program then
# operates functions vdecipher and decrypt on ciphertext and key to display
# reproduction of plaintext.
